### 2020 - [Australian Fires](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-07/readme.md) - Week 2
This data shows variation in temperature in seven Australian cities between 1950 and 2018.  Colors represent the difference of yearly average temperature (celsius) and the average temperature of the 68 year span.  Temperatures have increased over time and particularly in the past 10 years.
